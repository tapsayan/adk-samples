        "You've successfully used the User Simulation feature in ADK to dynamically evaluate a conversational agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a powerful technique that moves beyond static, single-turn prompts and allows you to test how your agent handles a natural, multi-turn conversation.\n",

        "**What you've learned**\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you learned how to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Define a \"conversation plan\" to guide the simulator's goals\n",
        "- Build a new evaluation set from your scenario files\n",
        "- Run a \"no-metrics\" evaluation to quickly test your conversation plan\n",
        "- Run a full evaluation to score your agent's performance on specific metrics\n",
        "- Configure the underlying model and settings for the user simulator\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps**\n",
        "\n",
        "To learn more, check out the official ADK documentation:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dive deeper: Read the [User Simulation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/evaluate/user-sim/) documentation\n",
